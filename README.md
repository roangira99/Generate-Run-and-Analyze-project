<h1> Generate, Search and Analyze project </h1>
<p>The main objective of this project is to use the binary search algorithm in a real world scenario where a user may want to search for
a specific email that is stored in a place with multiple emails e.g. a list or a database.
<br />
Project Objectives:<br>
•	generate random emails based on a list of domains and append to a list<br>
•	append an email you want to search for to the list<br>
•	sort the emails so as to perform bisection search on a sorted list of emails<br>
•	Run bisection search function to find the email from the sorted list of emails<br>
•   Analyze the runtime of the funtions to find out how long it took to generate the random emails and<br>
how long it took for the bisection search function to find the email you are looking for in the list
